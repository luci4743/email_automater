<!-- New Google changes -->
Google has recently made changes to access of less secure apps (read here: https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps).

In order to make your script work , you'll need to make a new app password for it. Directions to do so are below:

Go to My Account in Gmail and click on Security. After that, scroll down to choose the Signing into Google option.
Now, click on App Password. (Note: You can see this option when two-step authentication is enabled). To enable two-step authentication:
From the Signing into Google, click on the Two-step Verification option and then enter the password.
Then Turn ON the two-step verification by entering the OTP code received on the mobile.
(Here's a quick link to the same page: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)

Here, you can see a list of applications, choose the required one.
Next, pick the Select Device option and click on the device which is being used to operate Gmail.
Now, click on Generate.
After that, enter the Password shown in the Yellow bar.
Lastly, click on Done.

Simply switch out the password the script is using for this newly generated app password.

I hope this helps!
